The exercises are designed to offer a tiered level of understanding based on the background of the student. We will (for most lectures) take advantage of an open-source tool called KNIME (www.knime.org), with example workflows here (https://www.knime.org/example-workflows).  The basic exercises will require adding blocks in a workflow and adjusting parameters, while more advanced students will be able to write their own snippets, blocks or plugins to accomplish more complex tasks easily. \r\nThe exercises from last year (available on: kmader.github.io/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-Course/) are done entirely in ImageJ and Matlab for students who would prefer to stay in those environments (not recommended)\r\n\r\n#### Assistance\r\nThe exercises will be supported by Filippo Arcadu, Kevin Mader, and Christian Dietz. There will be office hours in ETZ H75 on Thursdays between 14-15 or by appointment.\r\n\r\n#### Specific Assignements\r\n\r\n- 19th February - Introduction and Workflows (Christian Dietz, Intro to KNIME for Image Processing)\r\n - [Setup](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2015/blob/master/Exercises/01-Description.md)\r\n - [Workflow and Data](http://tinyurl.com/knime-ws-eth)\r\n- 26th February - Image Enhancement (A.

For students who present a project, they will have the option to use their project for some of the real systems related questions (provided they have sent their slides to [Kevin](mailto:mader@biomed.ee.ethz.ch) after the presentation and bring a printed out copy to the exam including several image slices if not already in the slides).  The exam will cover all the lecture material from Image Enhancement to Scaling Up (the guest lecture will not be covered). Several example questions (not exhaustive) have been collected which might be helpful for preparation.\r\n- [Practice Questions](https://rawgithub.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-Course/master/PracticeExam/exam.html)\r\n\r\n### Other Material\r\n- Project Signup\r\n - Here you signup for your project with team members and a short title and description\r\n - [List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnOOBjdH2wMXdFNzVUNEUUc1WG1Cb21Gb24xZnQ5dWc&usp=sharing)\r\n- Course Wiki (For Questions and Answers, discussions etc)\r\n - [Main Page](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-Course/wiki/Course-Wiki-Page)\r\n- Performance Computing Courses\r\n - [High Performance Computing for Science and Engineering (HPCSE) I](http://cse-lab.ethz.ch/index.php/teaching/42-teaching/classes/577-hpcsei)\r\n - [Introduction to GPU Programming](http://cse-lab.ethz.ch/index.php/teaching/42-teaching/classes/576-etvgpufall2013)\r\n - [Programming Massively Parallel Processors with CUDA](https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/programming-massively-parallel/id384233322?mt=10)\r\n- Reprodudible Research Courses\r\n - [Course and Tools in R](http://kbroman.github.io/Tools4RR/)\r\n - [Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata)\r\n","google":"UA-48238118-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
